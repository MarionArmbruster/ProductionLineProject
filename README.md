# ProductionLineProject

This project is an stand-alone Oracle Academy step-by-step Java project in which the overarching purpose is to create a flexible structure that could be used in any type of production line. It will be added to and improved over the course of the Fall 2018 semester. It is built and run in IntelliJ IDE, but should be able to run in either Netbeans or Eclipse as well with or without minor changes.
