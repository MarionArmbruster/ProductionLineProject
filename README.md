# ProductionLineProject

This project is an stand-alone Java project created from an Oracle Academy step-by-step specifications document in which the overarching purpose is to create a flexible structure that could be used in any type of production line. It will be added to and improved over the course of the Fall 2018 semester (August - December 2018). It is built and run in IntelliJ IDE, but should be able to run in either Netbeans or Eclipse as well with or without minor changes.
